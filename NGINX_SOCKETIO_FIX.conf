# ========================================================
# NGINX CONFIGURATION FOR SOCKET.IO (WEBSOCKETS)
# ========================================================
# 
# 1. Add the "map" block OUTSIDE of the "server" block (at the top of your config)
# 2. Add the "location /socket.io/" block INSIDE your SSL server block (port 443)
# 
# IMPORTANT: If you are using HTTPS, you MUST put this in the server block 
# for port 443, usually managed by Certbot.

# --- PHASE 1: Add this Map block at the top of your config file ---
map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
    default upgrade;
    ''      close;
}

# --- PHASE 2: Update your server block ---
server {
    # If using SSL, this block starts with 'listen 443 ssl;'
    # ... your server_name and SSL cert paths ...
